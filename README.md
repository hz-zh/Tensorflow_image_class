# Tensorflow Image Class<br>
 A repository for the training of novel- and transfer training of existing- image classification TF models, by Henry Zelenak<br>

 -<br>
 Includes preprocessing and training directories for a subset of 6500 images from the CelebA dataset.<br>
 Also includes a submodule, models, which is a repo from the offical TensorFlow community that you need to train models.<br>

# Usage: <br> 
      Install Tensorflow in your chosen environment;
      Clone the models repo into your top-level project folder;
      Download the CelebA dataset to a storage location. (I used Google Drive);
      Edit the preprocessing script for your paths and class choices;
      Edit the training script for your data (model choice, paths, data dir structure);
      Train the model!

Note: The scripts assume default structure of the CelebA data dir.
