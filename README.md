# Tensorflow_image_class
 A repository for the transfer learning of existing TF models, by Henry Zelenak

 -
 Includes preprocessing and training directories for a subset of 6500 images from the CelebA dataset.
 Also includes a submodule, models, which is a repo from the offical TensorFlow community that you need to train models.
 
# Usage: 
        Install Tensorflow in your chosen environment;
        Clone the models repo into your top-level project folder;
        Download the CelebA dataset to a storage location. (I used Google Drive);
        Edit the preprocessing script for your paths and class choices;
        Edit the training script for your data (model choice, paths, data dir structure);
        Train the model!

Note: The scripts assume default structure of the CelebA data dir.
